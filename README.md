Project: Local Chatbot portfolio Web App

Description:
A simple, browser-based chatbot built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It works entirely offline and responds to basic user inputs using keyword matching logic.

Key Features:
- Chat interface between user and bot
- Predefined responses to common messages like "hi", "how are you", "bye"
- Completely local (no server or API needed)
- Mobile and desktop responsive

Technologies Used:
- HTML (for structure)
- CSS (for styling and layout)
- JavaScript (for logic and interaction)

How It Works:
- User types a message in the input box
- The JavaScript checks the input against predefined keywords
- The chatbot replies accordingly and displays it in the chat window

How to Run:
1. Open the folder named Local_Chatbot
2. Double-tap the file.
3. Start chatting with the bot directly
